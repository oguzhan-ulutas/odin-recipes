            <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the rotini at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 
                        about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
                    <li>Cook and stir sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes. 
                        Drain sausage on paper towels and reserve 2 tablespoons grease in the skillet. Add oil to grease in the skillet; cook and stir onion, 
                        garlic, and red pepper flakes in the hot oil-grease until onion is soft, about 3 minutes</li>
                    <li>Stir chicken broth, pumpkin, bacon, Italian seasoning, and salt into onion mixture; bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer for 5 minutes. 
                        Stir cream and sausage into broth mixture and simmer until creamy and thickened, about 5 minutes. Add rotini and gently toss. 
                        Transfer mixture to the prepared baking dish and top with Parmesan cheese.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and golden brown, about 35 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
